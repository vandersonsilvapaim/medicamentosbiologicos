Pós-Graduação Enfermagem Fundamental da Escola de Enfermagem de Ribeirão\nPreto da Universidade de São Paulo (EERP/USP), sob orientação da Profa Dra Marta Cristiane Alves Pereira e coorientação da Profa Dra Helaine Carneiro Capucho.\nEstou desenvolvendo o projeto de pesquisa intitulado Sistema de monitoramento de biossimilares:\ndesenvolvimento e avaliação de protótipo, aprovado pelo CEP EERP

Por isso uso esse método.\nO onerror é melhor em erros de compilação pois passa mais argumentos.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAIuWUQeN2I\nhttps://pt.stackoverflow.com/questions/144365/como-pegar-a-mensagem-detalhes-com-addeventlistenererror\nhttps://angular.io/api/core/ErrorHandler\n\n
